# MultiSource :warning:

A Terminator plugin that runs the `source ~/.bashrc` command on all open terminals of the active window.

It adds a menu item and also a keyboard shortcut that is currently hardcoded to Alt+S.

To install it, simply copy the multisource.py file to ~/.config/terminator/plugins and then enable it through the preferences menu. If you don't have a `plugins` directory under terminator, create one first!

Tested with Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04 and MX Linux 18.1.

#### Enjoy! :panda_face:
